# CI workflow: build + lint for the Android app
# Runs on push and pull_request. Uses Java 17 (Temurin) which is Android-compatible.
# Note: It's recommended to include the Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`) in the repo. If it's missing,
# this workflow falls back to using the `gradle` executable available on the runner (may not exist).
# If the repo doesn't contain a wrapper and the runner doesn't provide `gradle`, the job will fail and
# the recommended fix is to add the Gradle wrapper to the repository (run `gradle wrapper` locally).
